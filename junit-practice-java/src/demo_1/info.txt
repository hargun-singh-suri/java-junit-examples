1: Unit Test means - Testing a method
2: We have a method called printMessage which will print the message passed into constructor and
also return the value which is passed
3: We will create a class which will actually test if this method is working correctly ie
return the data which is passed
4: USING  org.junit.Assert.assertEquals for testing

	Get failure(s) using the getFailures() method of Result object.
